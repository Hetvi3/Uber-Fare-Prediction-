Ride-sharing services like Uber require accurate fare prediction to improve customer satisfaction and service efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model that uses various factors such as trip distance, passenger count, and time to estimate the cost of a ride.
The project leverages publicly available datasets and implements data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to develop a robust and interpretable prediction system.

Features  :



Machine Learning Model: Linear Regression for fare prediction.


Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and outlier detection.


Feature Analysis: Scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices for better insights.


Model Evaluation: R-squared, RMSE, and Cross-Validation for accuracy and reliability
